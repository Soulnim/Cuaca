This is my HarvardX CS50 Final Project!

### Description

Hi, my name i Luqman and I'm from Malaysia.

*I'd like to deploy my web app to a server , but i think they dont accept the cs50's SQL format
and maybe i need to use the SQLAlchemy next time.

# My Project

As I'm still a beginner, I had choosed to do a simple project instead of the complex one.
As my goals just to enhance my computer science basic knowledge such as building the frontend, backend and managing databases.

As for my final project, I had built a simple weather app called Cuaca that can be used to retreive the current
weather in searched area with an API.

Why it is called Cuaca?
Well, weather is called cuaca in my native language(Malay) and it quite simple too.

# specifications

I had implemented both backend and frontend in building the app.

Technology used:
1. Flask
2. Bootstrap
3. HTML/CSS
4. JavaScript

# login page

I had also build the login page for the user before they can use the app.

Why make a login page for a simple website?
Well, I love to collect user data.

# Data collected from users:
1. Username
2. Password
3. Email

If the user is not register yet, they can go to the register page to register, but if they had done,
they can go to login page instead

# homepage

In the homepage, I had build and designed to look like a product landing page.
And it is quite simple.

To proceed to the weather app, the user can click the 'Try Cuaca!' button in the middle.

# weather app page

I had used API_KEY from openweatherapp.com.
it contains many informations such as temperature, longitud, latitude and icon fo =r the weather.

I had choose only temperature, icon, and desciption only to make it simple as possible.

# my experience

For the first day, I had actually planned to build a chat app, but none of the resources work.
So, i got to plan B and it go well
Overall, it is a fun experience as i had to build an app of my own (except the debugging part).

# problem during building project

When i try to build the weather part, It got so many error. As i learned to build it by following a tutorial (Thanks PrettyPrinted fro the resources)
I had to challenge myself to convert the SQLALchemy format to CS50's SQL format and it is so painful.Glad i make it to the end.
It going well after i finished it in the midnight, but after the next day,
the code is error and i had to solve it on my own.
Overall it is good.

# Final words
I want to say thank you to the cs50 staff and community for the courses.
It is an honor to join the battle in learning programming, battling my own laziness, building my own disciplines.
By joining cs50, I feel like i am attending the college although it is just online.
The tension of submitting the assignments, self learning in gaining knowledge has taught me a lot.





That's all for now.





This is CS50!
